        "summary": "Murky beats and violent rhymes, I don't think I could describe it better than Legowelt so I'll just quote his description. \"Think over the top OMINOUS John Carpenter basslines, more tape smudge and obscurity then all minimal wave records in history, enchanting inspiring melodies and pure unadulterated poetry. Unknown to the large public and mostly forgotten, Memphis Rap is a truly unique rap/hiphop style that originated out of Memphis, Tennessee during the early 90s. The sound is extremely dark and electronic sometimes even bordering to the UK IDM sound. Best described as a slow electro style somewhat similar to the 1999 Orgue Electronique The Eye That Never Sleeps album combined with an Eazy-E NWA vibe mixed with raw synthetic soundtracks from the 1980s. <br /> In contrast to normal rap and hiphop the sampling of soul & RnB records is rare and the genre shines in mostly original produced tracks with thick synthetic John Carpenter style bass lines and mesmerizing hypnotic melodies. The drummachine of choice was the BOSS DR660 with its snappy lo-fi snares and build in synthbass sounds. If sampling occurs it is mostly from (horror)soundtracks and other (Memphis) rap tracks. Particular are the raps with unique tongue twisting telling the heroic stories of gangsters and their crime antics. Occult demon stuff, witchcraft and worship of weed are also common subjects in the lyrics. Some tracks don't even have raps but a few sampled snippets that keep repeating like a mantra for a drug crazed hazy lifestyle of crime. Vinyl releases were almost non existent in this scene, mixtapes on cassettes and CD's were the media of choice. The golden years of Memphis rap were probably from 1992 till around 1995 when the sound had a unique rawness created by lo-fi tape recordings, cheap MIDI equipment and the genius production skills of Tommy Wright III, DJ Sound, DJ Spanish Fly, DJ Paul and Lord Infamous. Sadly the style watered down as many artist went on to record other styles of rap music. Memphis Rap would evolve into Horror-core rap and together with Miami Bass it also lay the the foundation for Crunk music in the 1990s.\"",
